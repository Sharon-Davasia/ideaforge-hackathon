# Sample IdeaForge Conversation

## User Input

I have an idea for a mobile app called "FocusMate" - it's a
productivity app that uses AI to analyze your work patterns
and automatically schedules focus time blocks in your calendar.
It would integrate with Google Calendar and Slack to block
notifications during focus sessions. Target users are remote
workers and freelancers who struggle with distractions. The
main problem is that people spend hours planning when to work
instead of actually working.


## Orchestrator Response

🎉 That sounds like an awesome idea, thank you for sharing!

Before we get the whole team rolling, could you help me fill in a couple of details?

Timeline expectation – Do you have a target launch date or a rough timeframe?
Core features – Apart from AI-driven scheduling, are there any "must-have" features?
Platform scope – Will the app be native iOS/Android or cross-platform?


## User Follow-up
Timeline: 3 months for MVP launch
Core features: Just the basics - AI scheduling, Google Calendar integration,
Slack integration, and notification blocking. Analytics dashboard can be v2.
Platform: Cross-platform using React Native
